# COMS-321
You will be implementing bubble sort in LEGv8 assembly.  In a high(er) level language, implementing the entirety of bubble sort in a single function should be straightforward for students with your level of experience, but in assembly, it gets complicated fairly quickly.  To ameliorate some of the complication, we'll break the implementation into a number of procedures, none of which require nested loops.  Descriptions and implementations of these functions are given in the attached C file.
